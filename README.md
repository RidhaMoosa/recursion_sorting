Description
--------
Packages include:
  A) Recursion Functions:

    1) sum_array - gives the sum of an array/list of   integers in integer format

    2) fibonacci - gives the value (integer) of the positional number in the fibonacci sequence

    3) factorial - gives the factorial of a positive integer in integer format

    4) reverse - reverses the order of the letters in a word contained in string format; output is in string format

  B) Sorting Functions:

    All these functions order a list of integers in ascending order

    1) bubble_sort - most simple sorting algorithm; sorts out largest and smallest from the beginning of the list in a bubble which sweeps through the list

    2) merge_sort - splits a list which is then sorted using the first of its functions (merge); each recursive call made to subdivide the previously divided list, until the size reaches 1 and is ultimately sorted

    3) quick_sort - takes a number in the list (pivot) and divides the list into numbers less than the pivot number and greater than; it then repeats the process for each divided list until, like the merge algorithm, each list has 1 element.
